## 1. Introduction & Problem Formulation

The N-Queens problem asks for a placement of N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other (no shared rows, columns, or diagonals). We use a complete-state formulation: each column contains exactly one queen, and a state is a length-N array whose c-th element gives the row of the queen in column c. The goal is any state with heuristic value 0. The path cost is irrelevant since we only care about reaching any goal state via local search.

## 2. Heuristic Function

We use the standard heuristic h(s) = number of attacking pairs of queens in state s. Mathematically, for columns i < j with rows r_i and r_j, a conflict occurs if r_i = r_j (same row) or |r_i − r_j| = |i − j| (same diagonal). h(s) is the count of such pairs. Example for N=4: if state = [1, 3, 0, 2], h(s) = 0 because no two queens share a row or diagonal.

Global variables:

- DEFAULT_SIDEWAYS_LIMIT: maximum consecutive sideways moves (default 100)

- DEFAULT_RANDOM_RESTART_TRIALS: trials to average RR metrics (default 200)

- RESULTS_DIR: 'results' output path

- REPORTS_DIR: 'reports' output path

Key functions and signatures (purpose → inputs → outputs):

- compute_heuristic(state: List[int]) → int: number of attacking pairs

- generate_random_state(n: int, rng: Random) → List[int]: random complete state

- format_board(state: List[int]) → str: ASCII board visualization

- enumerate_neighbors(state) → List[(state, h, move)]: single-column moves

- choose_best_neighbors(state) → (best_states, best_h): neighbors with minimal h

- hill_climbing_search(initial_state, rng, allow_sideways, sideways_limit, record_sequence, max_steps) → RunResult

- random_restart_hill_climbing(n, rng, allow_sideways, sideways_limit, max_steps_per_restart) → (restarts, steps, time_ms)

- summarize_trials(...) → TrialSummary: aggregate metrics over many runs

- collect_sequences(...) → success/failure sequences for report

- run_fixed_trial_sets(...) → CSV and sequence file outputs

## 4. Hill-Climbing Algorithms

Basic Hill-Climbing (no sideways moves):

```
function HILL-CLIMBING(state):
  loop:
    best_neighbors ← neighbors with minimal h
    if min_h < h(state):
      state ← random choice(best_neighbors)
    else:
      return state  // local maximum or goal
```

Hill-Climbing with Sideways Moves (limit S):

```
function HILL-CLIMBING-SIDEWAYS(state, S):
  sideways ← 0
  loop:
    best_neighbors ← neighbors with minimal h
    if min_h < h(state):
      state ← random choice(best_neighbors); sideways ← 0
    else if min_h = h(state) and sideways < S:
      state ← random choice(best_neighbors); sideways ← sideways + 1
    else:
      return state
```

Random-Restart (using a chosen base climber):

```
function RANDOM-RESTART-CLIMB(N, climber):
  restarts ← 0; total_steps ← 0
  loop:
    state ← RANDOM-STATE(N)
    result ← climber(state)
    total_steps ← total_steps + result.steps
    if result.success: return (restarts, total_steps)
    restarts ← restarts + 1
```

### Section C: Random-Restart Hill-Climbing

Comparison with and without sideways moves:

| label | trials | avg_restarts | avg_total_steps | avg_total_time_ms |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| without_sideways | 200 | 6.47 | 24.02 | 4.306 |
| with_sideways | 200 | 0.09 | 23.39 | 3.267 |


## 6. Analysis & Discussion

Basic hill-climbing is fast but often gets stuck in local maxima or plateaus. Allowing sideways moves helps traverse plateaus, sometimes improving success rates, but may also linger without progress if the sideways limit is too high. Random restarts transform local search into an effective global search by repeatedly sampling different basins of attraction; combining this with sideways moves typically reduces expected restarts and total steps.

## 7. Conclusion

Among the tested approaches, random-restart hill-climbing with a moderate sideways-move limit achieves the highest reliability for N=8, with competitive total steps and time. This illustrates a key property of local search: strategic randomness can overcome local optima efficiently.
